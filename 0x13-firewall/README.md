0x13 Firewall Configuration
This project involves configuring a firewall on a server to enhance its security. The firewall rules are set to allow or block specific incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined criteria.

Description
The goal of this project is to implement a firewall configuration on a server to control the network traffic entering and leaving the system. By setting up firewall rules, we can ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed while blocking potentially harmful or unauthorized connections.

Requirements
Ubuntu server
Basic knowledge of networking and firewall concepts
Access to the server with administrative privileges
Installation
There is no installation required for this project. However, ensure that you have SSH access to your Ubuntu server and administrative privileges to configure the firewall.

Usage
Follow these steps to configure the firewall:

Connect to your Ubuntu server via SSH.

Run the provided Bash script 0-firewall_ABC to configure the firewall according to the specific requirements of the project.

bash
Copy code
chmod +x 0-firewall_ABC
./0-firewall_ABC
The script will prompt you to enter firewall rules based on the scenario provided in each task.

Follow the prompts and input the required rules to configure the firewall accordingly.

Once the script execution is complete, verify that the firewall rules are applied correctly by checking the firewall status.

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status verbose
Test the firewall by attempting to access services or ports that should be allowed or blocked based on the configured rules.
