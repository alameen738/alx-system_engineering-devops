## Overview
In this repository, we maintain the configuration for monitoring our web stack, including servers, applications, and services, using Datadog. Datadog provides us with real-time visibility into our infrastructure's health, performance, and availability.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Datadog account](https://www.datadoghq.com/) with API and Application keys
- Servers or virtual machines where the Datadog Agent will be installed

### Installation
To install the Datadog Agent, follow the instructions provided in the [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/).

### Configuration
After installing the Datadog Agent, ensure it is properly configured with your Datadog API and Application keys. The configuration file is typically located at `/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml`.

## Monitoring

### Metrics
Datadog collects metrics from various sources, including servers, containers, databases, and applications. These metrics provide insights into resource utilization, performance, and other key indicators of our web stack's health.

### Logs
In addition to metrics, Datadog also collects logs from our servers and applications. Log data helps us troubleshoot issues, track user activity, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Alerting
Datadog allows us to set up alerts based on predefined thresholds or custom conditions. These alerts notify us of potential issues or anomalies in our web stack, enabling us to take proactive action to prevent downtime or performance degradation.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve our web stack monitoring setup. If you have suggestions, bug fixes, or enhancements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
